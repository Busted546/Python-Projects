# Getting Started
Python is a widely-used programming language in data analytics and automation. Its flexibility and readability make it ideal for handling tasks such as data manipulation, reporting, visualization, and process automation. Whether working with structured or unstructured data, Python provides powerful capabilities to build end-to-end solutions.

This portfolio is designed for anyone interested in understanding how Python can be applied to real-world data workflows â€” from data ingestion and transformation to analysis, modeling, and automation.
